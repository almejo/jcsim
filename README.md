# JCSim

*Important*: JCSim is not supported anymore. I am currently working in a new circuit simulator, VSIM. You can go and check 
this project in [https://github.com/almejo/vsim](https://github.com/almejo/jcsim)

## What is JCSim

JCSim is a digital circuit simulator written in Java. It is based on CSim, a digital circuits simulator written by Luis Mateu for the Commodore Amiga. JCSim is written in java and it was my thesis work at the university. 

JCSim tries to be a tool to learn how computers works. I allow you to implement logic circuits. If you have the time you can simulate a 
complete computer and run programs. 

## What it can do

JCSim can simulate a logical circuit. The editor has the following features:

- Start/pause simulatio
- Use multiples windows with the same circuit (views)
- Create gates: And, Or, Not, etc...
- Debut gates: switches, clocks, state indicators
- Create new gates with new functionality (encapsulated gates)
- Connect/Disconnect gates using wires
- Clone gates
- Limitless canvas 
- Load/Save 

## What it cant't do

JCSim lack some basic features: 

- good load/save : all data is serialized to disk 
- undo/redo
- cut/copy/paste of circuit/gates
- color schemes
- data buses
 
## Future of jcsim

I do not work anymore in JCSim. I will clean up some code sometimes, but I will no add new features.
